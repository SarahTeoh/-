# Presentation Skills Assessment system using Smart Mirror
## Background 
In the globalization era, presentation skills, especially in English, is required in almost every field, and most of us are required to give presentations on occasions. Needless to say, to be good at giving presentations, we need to practice. Practicing with and receiving feedback
from a mentor is believed to be the best way to improve presentation skills. However, it is not easy to find someone to have time to practice with you always. That's why we need this Presentation Skills Assessment system.

## What can the system do?
With this system, you will be able to practice your presentation by just standing in front of a Smart Mirror anytime you want, without the need of someone. The system will give you [real-time feedback](#Feedback-from-system) about your presentation on these aspects:
* Speech rate
* Tone
* Smoothness of speech
* Overall time
